# Comprehensive Java Coding Guidelines


1. Introduction
This document provides detailed coding guidelines, principles, and best practices for Java development. The aim is to ensure consistent, readable, and maintainable code across all Java projects.

## Code Formatting

### Indentation
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Avoid using tabs.
- Align code blocks for readability.

### Line Length
- Limit lines to 80 characters. If a line exceeds this limit, break it into multiple lines.

### Braces
- Use braces for all control structures (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, etc.).
- Place the opening brace on the same line as the statement.
- Place the closing brace on a new line.

```java
if (condition) {
    // code
} else {
    // code
}

2.4. Whitespace
Use a single blank line to separate logical sections of code.
Avoid trailing whitespace.


3. Naming Conventions

3.1. Classes and Interfaces
Use UpperCamelCase for class and interface names.

public class EmployeeManager {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}

3.2. Methods
Use lowerCamelCase for method names.

public void calculateSalary() {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}

3.3. Variables
Use lowerCamelCase for variable names.
Use meaningful and descriptive names that indicate the purpose of the variable.

int employeeId;
String employeeName;

3.4. Constants
Use all uppercase letters with underscores separating words.

public static final int MAX_EMPLOYEES = 100;


4. Code Structure

4.1. Package Structure
Organize packages by feature or module.
Use lowercase letters for package names.

com.company.project.feature

4.2. Class Structure
Order elements within a class as follows:
Static variables
Instance variables
Constructors
Methods

public class Employee {
    private static int employeeCount;
    private int employeeId;
    private String employeeName;

    public Employee(int id, String name) {
        this.employeeId = id;
        this.employeeName = name;
    }

    public void calculateSalary() {
        // Consider your own Implementation
    }
}


5. Use of final

5.1. Variables
Use final for variables that should not be reassigned after initialization.

final int MAX_EMPLOYEES = 100;

5.2. Methods
Use final for methods that should not be overridden by subclasses.


public final void printEmployeeDetails() {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}

5.3. Classes
Use final for classes that should not be subclassed.

public final class UtilityClass {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}


6. Object Creation and Management

6.1. Avoiding Multiple Objects for the Same Purpose
Use the Singleton pattern for classes where only one instance is needed.

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
6.2. Object Pooling
Use object pooling for managing the reuse of expensive objects.

import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;

public class ObjectPool<T> {
    private ConcurrentLinkedQueue<T> pool = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();

    public T borrowObject() {
        T object = pool.poll();
        return (object != null) ? object : createNewObject();
    }

    public void returnObject(T object) {
        pool.offer(object);
    }

    private T createNewObject() {
        // Consider your own Implementation to create a new object
    }
}
6.3. Lazy Initialization
Use lazy initialization to delay object creation until needed.

public class LazyInit {
    private SomeObject someObject;

    public SomeObject getSomeObject() {
        if (someObject == null) {
            someObject = new SomeObject();
        }
        return someObject;
    }
}
7. Documentation and Comments
7.1. Javadoc Comments
Use Javadoc for all public classes and methods to describe their purpose and usage.

/**
 * Represents an employee in the company.
 */
public class Employee {
    /**
     * Calculates the salary of the employee.
     */
    public void calculateSalary() {
        // Consider your own Implementation
    }
}
7.2. Inline Comments
Use inline comments sparingly and only when the code is not self-explanatory.

public void calculateSalary() {
    int baseSalary = 50000; // Base salary in USD
    // Consider your own Implementation
}


8. Error Handling
8.1. Exceptions
Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and unchecked exceptions for programming errors.

public void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}

8.2. Logging
Use a logging framework (e.g., SLF4J) instead of System.out.println for logging.

private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Employee.class);

public void calculateSalary() {
    logger.info("Calculating salary");
    // Consider your own Implementation
}


9. Testing

9.1. Unit Tests
Write unit tests for all public methods.
Use a testing framework (e.g., JUnit) and follow best practices for test organization and naming.

public class EmployeeTest {
    @Test
    public void testCalculateSalary() {
        Employee employee = new Employee(1, "John Doe");
        // Consider your own Implementation
    }
}

9.2. Code Coverage
Aim for high code coverage but focus on writing meaningful tests rather than achieving 100% coverage.


10. Version Control

10.1. Commit Messages
Use clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made. Follow a consistent format (e.g., type: description).
plaintext

feat: add salary calculation method to Employee class
fix: correct employee ID assignment in Employee constructor


11. Thread Safety

11.1. Synchronization
Use synchronization to ensure that methods or code blocks are thread-safe when accessed concurrently.

public synchronized void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}

11.2. Concurrent Collections
Use concurrent collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap) for thread-safe operations.

ConcurrentMap<String, Employee> employeeMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();


12. Resource Management

12.1. Try-with-Resources
Use try-with-resources for managing resources that need to be closed, such as streams and readers.

try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    // Consider your own Implementation
}

12.2. Closing Resources
Ensure all resources are properly closed in a finally block if not using try-with-resources.

finally {
    if (br != null) {
        br.close();
    }
}


13. Design Patterns

13.1. Factory Pattern
Use the Factory pattern to create objects without specifying the exact class of object to be created.

public class EmployeeFactory {
    public static Employee createEmployee(String type) {
        if (type.equals("manager")) {
            return new Manager();
        } else if (type.equals("developer")) {
            return new Developer();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

13.2. Singleton Pattern
Use the Singleton pattern to ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.

public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

13.3. Observer Pattern
Use the Observer pattern to define a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing one object to notify others of state changes.

public interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

public class Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addObserver(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void notifyObservers(String message) {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(message);
        }
    }
}


14. Code Optimization

14.1. Avoid Premature Optimization
Do not optimize code until it is necessary. Focus on writing clean and maintainable code first.

14.2. Use Efficient Algorithms
Choose the right data structures and algorithms for tasks to improve performance.


List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
Collections.sort(employees, Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary));

14.3. Minimize Object Creation
Reuse objects instead of creating new ones where possible to reduce memory overhead.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
// Reuse StringBuilder instead of creating a new one in a loop


15. Security

15.1. Input Validation
Validate all input to ensure it meets expected formats and ranges to prevent security vulnerabilities.

public void setEmployeeId(int id) {
    if (id <= 0) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("ID must be positive");
    }
    this.employeeId = id;
}

15.2. Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Information
Do not hardcode passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information in the source code. Use configuration files or environment variables instead.

Properties props = new Properties();
props.load(new FileInputStream("config.properties"));
String password = props.getProperty("db.password");

15.3. Use Secure APIs
Use secure APIs and libraries to handle cryptographic operations and other security-sensitive tasks.


16. Principles and Best Practices

16.1. SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

16.2. DRY Principle
Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid duplication of code. Reuse code wherever possible.

16.3. KISS Principle
Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS): Write code that is simple and easy to understand.

16.4. YAGNI Principle
You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI): Do not add functionality until it is necessary.

16.5. Principle of Least Astonishment
Principle of Least Astonishment: Code should behave in a way that least surprises other developers.
